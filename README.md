# Username Mentions

This NodeBB plugin allows posters to reference (or *mention*) other users on a NodeBB by simply
precluding the `@` symbol before a username.

A link is automatically added to the post.

# Update
Adds username(Fullname) in the autofill list instead of just username

## Installation

    npm install nodebb-plugin-custom-mentions

... or if you're feeling particularly risky, clone this repo and use `npm link` to "install" this plugin.
